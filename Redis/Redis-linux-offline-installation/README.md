# Redis

Installation steps :

Make sure you have make and gcc already installed, else you can't compile the sources for Redis.

Download following files :
1. redis-4.0.11.tar.gz
2. redis-installer.sh
3. redis-sentinel and redis-server

If you want to copy the scripts from git, use the raw mode (access the script and in top corner you have a button called Raw - near Blame and History)

After you downloaded the files, copy them to the server and run following commands :

`chmod +x redis-installer.sh` </br>
`./redis-installer.sh`
